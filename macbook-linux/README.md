# Stuff for making linux work on a macbook

I had to do a lot of tweaking to make the macbook's touchpad work in a normal linux/windows right/left
click kind of way. I used mtrack from [https://github.com/BlueDragonX/xf86-input-mtrack]
plus the tweaked options in xorg.conf

I don't have it set up for a virtual 3-button mouse, because I think 2 works better on a touchpad.

I also had to mess with xmodmap a bit, but I suspect that might be model and distro specific, and I still
haven't quite figured it out.

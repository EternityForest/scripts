# Desktop Linux Basics

This is the stuff I install on all my machines with sufficient disk space, just in case I want it later...
It's stuff like Back in Time, my favorite backup utility, SyncThing, the easiest way to do file sync,
WXMaxima, a nice math app, etc.

Basically, it's the stuff I'd choose if I was making a "batteries included" distro.

install.sh is general purpose, install_programming.sh is mostly of interest to programmers only, but
doesn't have stuff for specific languages. It's got things like Git and Meld, my favorite merge tool.

This only works on Ubuntu derivatives and maybe Debian so far as I know. Run install.sh as root, and tell minimalism
to take a hike! 

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THEY ARE SHORT SCRIPTS, READ BEFORE USING.
